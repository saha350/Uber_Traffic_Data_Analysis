# Uber_Traffic_Data_Analysis
In this Power Bi project, all the data has been compared using different shifts and the delayed time. Here the range of the upper bound is also analyzed where the maximum upper bound is predicted in the morning shift compared to mid-day and evening shift. The delay time in morning (A.M.) and Evening (P.M.) ranges have also been predicted.
